Want to contribute? Great! First, read this page.

### Before you contribute
Please be sure that you link the pre-commit git hook at:
  ./.githooks/pre-commit

into your cloned code's .git/hooks directory. The pre-commit hook creates
a coverage report upon commit for the code in this project. Additionally,
the coverage_badge is created with:
  https://github.com/jpoles1/gopherbadger

### Code reviews
All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use Github pull requests for this purpose, and the Github CODEOWNERS configuration
automatically adds reviewers to all pull requests at creation time.
